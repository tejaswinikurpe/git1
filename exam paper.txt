1st core python exam

Q.1  Accept input values into 2 variables and swap them. Also write a program to accept no. 
of hours and convert it to minutes and seconds(minutes=hours*60,seconds=hours*3600)

Answer:
  
a=eval(input("\nEnter the 1st number:"))
b=eval(input("\nEnter the 2nd number:"))
a,b=b,a
print("\n The swapping values are:",a,b)

convert hours in minutes and seconds

hours=eval(input("\n Enter the hours:"))
minutes=hours*60
print("\n The hours in minutes are",minutes)

seconds=hours*3600
print("\n The hours in seconds are",seconds)


Q.2 Explain integer data type in Python and explain all the different number systems in integer 
category and also explain how to represent values in binary, hexadecimal and octal formats in Python

Answer: In integer type includes all positive and negative numbers without any decimal points.
There are different number system in integer data type :
1.Decimal number system: This includes all real numbers. decimal number system has base 10. so it allowed digits are 0-9.
e.g - 3,5,-9,546,888 etc.

2.Binary number system : in binary system allowed digits are 0 and 1.
In binary system we have to use 0B or 0b before the number 
e.g a=0b10 or a=0B110
if we write a=10 then the number becomes decimal number.

3.octal number system : In octal number system has base 8. so allowed numbers are 0-7
we need to use 0O or 0o before the number in octal system 
e.g a=0O704
if we write a=704 then the number becomes decimal number.

4.Hexadecimal number system : In hexadecimal system has base 16. so allowed numbers are 0-15. but here we have to 
use alphabets a-f for 10-15 respectively. e.g a=10,b=11,c=12,d=13,e=15 and f=15. also we need to use 0x or 0X Before
the number.
 a=0XBE10 (B=11,E=15)

Q.3 Write a Python program to accept input values into 2 variables and perform all arithmatic operations like 
addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,remainder, exponentiation and floor division between them.

Answer: 
a=eval(input("\n Enter the 1st number:))
b=eval(input("\n Enter the 2nd number:))
c=a+b
print("\n The addition is",c)
c=a-b
print("\n The substraction is",c)
c=a*b
print("\n The multiplication is",c)
c=a/b
print("\n The division is",c)
c=a//b
print("\n The floor division is",c)
c=a%b
print("\n The remainder is",c)
c=a**b
print("\n The exponentiation is",c)


Q.4 Write a Python program to accept 2 complex numbers from user and perform all arithmatic operations on them
Anwser:
a=eval(input("\n Enter the 1st real number"))
b=eval(input("\n Enter the 1st imaginary number"))
x=eval(input("\n Enter the 2nd real number"))
y=eval(input("\n Enter the 2nd imaginary number"))

d1=(a,b)
d2=(x,y)


d3=d1+d2
print("\n The addition is",d3)
d3=d1-d2
print("\n The substraction is",d3)
d3=d1*d2
print("\n The multiplication is",d3)
d3=d1/d2
print("\n The division is",d3)
d3=d1//d2
print("\n The floor division is",d3)
d3=d1%d2
print("\n The remainder is",d3)
d3=d1**d2
print("\n The exponentiation is",d3)

Q.5  Write a Python program to accept the radius of sphere from user and display volume and area
Volume=(4/3)pi(cube of radius)
Area=4*pi*r*r

Answer:
import math
 
Radius=eval(input("\n Enter the Radius of sphere"))
 
Volume=(4/3)*math.pi*Radius*Radius*Radius
print("\n The Volume of sphere is",Volume)
 
Area=4*math.pi*Radius*Radius
print("\n The Area of sphere is",Area)

Q.6. Write a Python program to accept lengths of 3 sides of triangle and find perimeter and area
peri=(a+b+c)
area=squareroot(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
s=(a+b+c)/2
 
Answer:
import math as p 

a=eval(input("\n Enter the length of side 1"))
b=eval(input("\n Enter the length of side 2"))
c=eval(input("\n Enter the length of side 3"))

perimeter=(a+b+c)
print("\n The perimeter of triangle is",perimeter)
s=(a+b+c)/2
print("\n The side of triangle is",s)
area=p.sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
print("\n The area of triangle is",area)

Q.7. Explain properties of list data type in python. What is output of?
m=[11,2,8,9,21,22,'abc def']
print(m[4])
print(m[-4])
print(m[2:5])

Answer:
The output is :
21
9
